# How to contribute

Even though this is a Udacity project for my Nanodegree, I plan on allowing my children to play this web app. Adding the mentioned features in the [README.md](README.md) is what I'm looking for.

I'll also accept any image suitable to replace the bugs.

If you want to contribute, and all help is appreciated, please contact me before the pull request. Also, please don't use any colors besides the ones already in the `app.css` file.
